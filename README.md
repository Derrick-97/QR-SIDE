# QR-SIDE
Robust spatial cell-type deconvolution with qualitative reference for spatial transcriptomics

QR-SIDE is a package for annotation on spatial transcriptomics datasets developed by Jin Liu's lab. It has the capability to effectively leverage a large number of non-marker genes as well as “qualitative” information about marker genes without using a reference dataset. Uniquely, SpatialAnno estimates low-dimensional embeddings for a large number of non-marker genes via a factor model while promoting spatial smoothness among neighboring spots via a Potts model
