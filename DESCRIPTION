Title: Robust Spatial Cell-Type Deconvolution with Qualitative Reference for Spatial Transcriptomics
Description: QR-SIDE is a package for cell type deconvolution on spatial transcriptomics datasets developed by Jin Liu's lab. It has the capability to effectively leverage a large number of non-marker genes as well as "qualitative" information about marker genes without using a reference dataset. QR-SIDE can quantify the spatial heterogeneity of individual marker genes using a mixture Poisson regression model, and simultaneously perform spatial clustering by specifying the latent spot-separable topics. Using a Potts model, QR-SIDE integrates spatial information to promote spatial continuity for the identified spatial domains.
